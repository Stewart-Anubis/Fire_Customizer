# Fire_Customizer

### Improved version of zombiereloaded plugin with support for CS:GO and CS:S

* Test & Compile, SouceMod 1.10.0-6492
* Sorry for my English.

* Author Anubis.
* Version = 1.3

### Decription: Fire_Customizer

* Add custom fire particles (Example Blue Fire, Green Etc.)
* The plugim does not generate a configuration file. The plugin has two cvars to define particles, you can add them to the map configuration, to have the different fire per map or just not change and leave the blue fire by default.
* Obs. Don't forget to put the "particles/" folder in fastdl for download, without it it won't work.

### Server ConVars

* sm_fire_ignite_name - Default "burning_fx_sblue" - Defines the particle system file to be used for the ignite particles.
* sm_fire_inferno_name - Default "inferno_fx_alt" - Defines the particle system file to be used for the inferno particles.

### Thanks

* Chester the Cheetah - fire_customizer
